A web app from [Lance](https://github.com/lancechise), [Jenna](https://github.com/JennaMeri625), [Jessica](https://github.com/trelaj) and [Omar](https://github.com/omareo22).

## Features

- Musico is an app that creates a searchable database of musicians. A musician/artist signs up on the app and fills in the form to create their profile which includes who they are, a small bio of what they do and contact information. Clients are then able to search through the musicians who have created profiles.  They can search with or without signing up, though contact information is omitted without signup.
  
- Expressive and intuitive UI to be an efficient and user-friendly app. 

- Included in the musician profile is a map with the area they stated they are willing to travel to for a job/performance based on their zip code input.

## Future Goals

- Allow the clients to be able to create their own "Looking for..." pages that musicians could search through.

## Technologies Used

Musico was written using React with the google maps API created using Express and MongoDB. Mobile-responsive for phone, tablet, and laptop. This app is hosted in the cloud with Firebase.
