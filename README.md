A web app from [Lance](https://github.com/lancechise), [Jenna](https://github.com/JennaMeri625), [Jessica](https://github.com/trelaj) and [Omar](https://github.com/omareo22).

## Features

- Musico is an app that creates a searchable database of musicians. A musician/artist signs up on the app and fills in the form to create their profile which includes who they are, a small bio of what they do and contact information. Clients are then able to search through the musicians who have created profiles.  They can search with or without signing up, though contact information is omitted without signup.

- Included in the musician profile is a map with the area they stated they are located based on their zip code input.

## Future Goals

- Allow the clients to be able to create their own "Looking for..." pages that musicians could search through.
